This Rust program shows operations on the direct product of multiplicative groups of units $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$. It provides functionality for generating the elements of these groups, computing the product of elements using modular arithmetic, and determining the modular inverse of elements.
